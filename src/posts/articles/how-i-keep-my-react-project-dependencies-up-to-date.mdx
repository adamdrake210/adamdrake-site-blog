Starting a new project is always exciting but when it comes to maintaining
projects and their package dependencies you often find your enthusiasm
dwindling. Over the years though I have evolved a process which works for me and
enables me to keep my npm packages up to date on my active projects.

## Consistency

Unfortunately there isn’t anything sexy or glamorous about maintaining your
repos packages. It requires a long term approach and being able to maintain a
consistent low level of effort over that period.

## Reminders

For this I use calendar reminders (Google or Microsoft Outlook calendar work
just fine) and I set up a recurring calendar invite for 30mins every 2 weeks.
Therefore I don’t have to remember to update my repo, I just treat it like any
other recurring meeting.

## Checking Package Versions

For this I use an npm library called
[npm-check-updates](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates). I have it
installed globally on my machine and it’s very simple to use. I navigate to the
repo of choice and run the command:

```
ncu
```

Simple right!? This then checks all the dependencies in your package.json and
shows the versions you have installed and which ones have updates available.
Something like this:

<ImageComponent
  src="ncu_screenshot.png"
  altText="Screenshot of ncu log"
  height={440}
  width={960}
/>

From the given output you can see which packages could update and to which
version so you can see if it’s a minor version update or a major version update.

## Don’t update too much at once

This part is very important! When you first start doing this on repos
(especially if they haven’t been touched for a while) then the output from
running ncu can be really long and you maybe tempted to update everything all at
once. After all its just one command with this npm-check-updates package:

```
ncu -u
```

However, in my experience this can cause more pain that it’s worth. The pace at
which the packages on npm update is fast so you can expect if you haven’t
updated packages on your repo for even 6 months that there will be some major
updates and with major updates come breaking changes!! And these can very easily
break your app or break a certain feature within your app.

## Slowly Slowly Catch a Monkey

I tend to focus one of these update sessions by either updating all packages
with minor updates or on one package with a major update. If a major update I
ALWAYS go to the Github release notes and check what the changes are. Then I
will update the package either by running

```
npm install <package-name>@<version-number || latest>
```

or

```
ncu <package-name>
```

Once the package is updated then I make sure to run all tests, linting, type
checking, run the app and check for any errors or console errors. From my
experience by doing these updates regularly you rarely run into an update that
will cause you big problems to implement.

## Conclusion

I have heard quite a few different approaches to keeping packages up to date in
repos with frequency of updates varying from a week all the way to every 6
months. Some people like to wait ages and then update everything at once and
spend a day making sure everything works. Some people (like me) prefer the —
do-a-little-bit-often-over-a-long-time-approach — I don’t think one method is
the best but you need to choose what works for you.
