I recently was creating a new Nextjs application and I ran into a problem where
if I refreshed the page manually on the keyboard Nextjs would start screaming at
me and my console was full of error messages. Like the below:

<ImageComponent
  src="nextjs_error_react_hydration.png"
  altText="Screenshot Nextjs Error caused by misuse of React."
  height={651}
  width={728}
/>

For me the error message was a little cryptic:

```
Warning: Expected server HTML to contain a matching <button> in <button>.
```

> It tells you that this sort of error occurs when some code on your page is
> relying on something that could differ between pre-rendering and the browser.

It turns out it was a React Hydration Error. After a bit of googling I stumbled
upon this page:
[https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/react-hydration-error](https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/react-hydration-error).
It tells you that this sort of error occurs when some code on your page is
relying on something that could differ between pre-rendering and the browser.
This is connected with server-side-rendering (SSR) and if you don’t take the
time to sit down and understand it properly it will no doubt catch you out at
some point (like it just did for me!!).

There is
[this article](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/the-perils-of-rehydration/)
from [Josh Comeau](https://twitter.com/JoshWComeau) who does a great job of
explaining why this error occurs and what you can do to resolve it. There is
also the same solution found in this
[Github Issue](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/17443) on the
Nextjs Github Repo.

## Code changes

This was my code before:

<ImageComponent
  src="react_hydration_code_before.png"
  altText="React Code before change"
  height={675}
  width={728}
/>

This was my code after:

<ImageComponent
  src="react_hydration_code_after.png"
  altText="React Code after change"
  height={722}
  width={728}
/>

Now the error has gone away!

## Conclusion

I have to say that Josh Comeau’s analogy with the cereal box in his article
really helped illustrate the point for me. Cereal boxes can be printed way in
advance (static non personal content) and then when the cereal is actually put
in the box the ‘sell by date’ can be printed on the box (dynamic content).

Thinking about it like this can really help you analyze your app’s content and
code and then make informed decisions about how to lay it out.
