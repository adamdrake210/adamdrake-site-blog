<p style={{ fontSize: '20px' }}>
  Recently I read the wonderfully insightful book on learning and performance at
  an extremely high level - 
  <strong>The Art of Learning by Josh Waitzkin</strong> - and I was very captivated
  by one idea. The idea of <strong>'building your trigger'</strong>. The reason I
  was so caught by this idea was the practicality and potential wide range of use
  for it.

## The idea in a nutshell

_The whole idea of 'Building your trigger' is to get yourself in the right
mental state and focused for performing some act at a high level._

For example, take presenting at work to a crowd of 50 colleagues. For many
people this can be a very nerve wracking experience and can cause a wide range
of emotions in the lead up to the presentation and during the presentation
itself. Anxiety about how the presentation will go and fear of things going
wrong during the presentation itself.

Josh's idea is to work on a routine over a period of time, say 30 days, where
you would work purely on getting yourself into the zone or into a state of flow.
Professional athletes do this before every game. They come up with a
deliberately designed routine where they can consistently get themselves into
the zone. Once in the zone the level of performance is guaranteed to be much
higher than if you were to lead everything to chance.

## How you can build a trigger

Josh's main idea is deceptively simple. You have to search through your life and
find an activity you do regularly where you have a feeling of flow. It doesn't
matter what you are doing at this time of being in the zone but there must be
something. For some it will be walking, for others it will be playing with their
children, for others it will be some sort of exercise or meditation technique.

Once you discover this activity then it is a matter of building a routine
leading up to this activity every day for 30 days or so. This is training
yourself and creating a routine you can then transfer over to your performance.

The example given in 'The Art of Learning' is a business leader who always felt
nervous during big presentations and tended not to perform to the level he felt
he could. So after discussions with Josh they discovered the time of day he
feels most relaxed is when he played ball with his son at their home. **So they
built a routine around this activity**. The routine started out like this:

- Eat a light consistent snack for 10 minutes
- 15 minutes meditation
- 10 minutes stretching
- 10 minutes listening to some Bob Dylan
- Play ball with his son

The business leader then performed this routine for 30 days. Playing ball with
his son was always a joy and he was always in a relaxed state. He was training
himself to consistently get in a state of flow by doing something he enjoyed
doing anyway.

_The next step is the crucial step - Transferring this routine over to where you
want to implement it into other 'pressure' situations in your life._ In this
example the business leader transferred it over to the time before big
presentations. He did exactly the same routine (except the playing ball with his
son!) before the presentation and by the time he reached the presentation he was
in such a relaxed state that he breezed through the presentation and it went
much better than usual.

## Condensing the routine

One has to be practical though and we all are leading busy lives. This example
routine is great because it is extremely transportable and can be performed
pretty much anywhere. However, in all likelihood you won't have 45 minutes
before every moment you want to get into this state.

Therefore to make this routine lower maintenance and more flexible, the idea is
to incrementally reduce the amount of time on each part of the routine **BUT**
keeping it similar enough it will still produce the same physiological effect.

The leader gradually reduced the time spent on each activity in his routine over
a number of days. By doing this gradually he was able to retain the impact of
the routine but condense the actual routine into a much shorter period.
Eventually he reduced the time for the routine down to 12 minutes and it was
still just as potent.

## Conclusion

If there is any area of your life where you would like to perform at a high
level consistently, incorporating a 'trigger' into your life can really help
you. It gives you a predictable and reliable method to getting 'into the zone'.

The beauty of this practice is a trigger can be created for anyone and catered
to that person's specific needs. If incorporated correctly it can become
extremely powerful, transportable and potent.

It requires some thought and dedication to build the habit into your life but
once that work is done you have a great addition to your tool chest to help you
achieve your goals.
