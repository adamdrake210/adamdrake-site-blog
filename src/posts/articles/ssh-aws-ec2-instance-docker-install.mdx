This article will show you how to `ssh` into an EC2 instance set up on AWS and
install docker.

First you will need to create a key/pair on AWS. Once you have created that,
then download the key onto your machine.

Restrict access to that key:

```
chmod 400 ~/Downloads/server-key.pem
```

_(Replace the path to the key to whereever you have saved the key on your
machine.)_

Then you can ssh into the server with that key:

```
ssh -i ~/Downloads/server-key.pem ubuntu@70.45.277.243
```

Type `yes` when prompted.

Next you want to run an update to make sure everything on the server is up to
date:

```
sudo apt update
```

Then you can install docker:

```
sudo apt install docker.io
```

Once this installation process has finished you can log out of the machine
(ctrl + d) and log back in to complete the installation.

To test it is working as expected:

```
docker ps
```

It should print out this:

<ImageComponent
  src="ncu_screenshot.png"
  altText="Screenshot of ncu log"
  height={440}
  width={960}
/>
