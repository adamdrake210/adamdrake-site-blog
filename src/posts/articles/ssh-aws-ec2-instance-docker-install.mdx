I was recently setting up an EC2 instance on AWS and thought it would be useful
to document the very common terminal commands that are needed to set up your
instance to work with **docker** containers and **docker-compose**. This article
will show you how to **ssh** into an EC2 instance set up on AWS and install
**docker** and **docker-compose**.

Once you have launched your instance on the AWS console you will then need to
create a **key/pair**. Select the key pair type you want and the Private key
format. For this application I chose:

<ImageComponent
  src="key-pair-aws-instance-ec2.png"
  altText="Screenshot of key pair creation on EC2 instance of AWS"
  height={540}
  width={960}
/>

Once you have created that, then download the key onto your machine.

Restrict access to that key:

```
chmod 400 ~/Downloads/server-key.pem
```

_(Replace the path to the key to whereever you have saved the key on your
machine.)_

Then you can ssh into the server with that key:

```
ssh -i ~/Downloads/server-key.pem ubuntu@70.45.277.243
```

Type **yes** when prompted to finalise the ssh process into the server.

Next you want to run an update to make sure everything on the server is up to
date:

```
sudo apt update
```

Then you can install docker:

```
sudo apt install docker.io
```

Once this installation process has finished you can log out of the machine
(ctrl + d) and log back in to complete the installation.

To test it is working as expected, ssh back into the machine and type:

```
docker ps
```

It should print out this:

<ImageComponent
  src="docker-ps-command.png"
  altText="Screenshot of docker-ps command"
  height={80}
  width={728}
/>

Next install docker-compose

```
sudo apt install docker-compose
```

And again once this installation process has finished you can log out of the
machine (ctrl + d) and log back in to complete the installation.

## Conclusion

So thats it! Nothing super complicated there but it's the sort of thing you do
regularly enough that you need to know this process but not regularly enough
that you can remember all the steps easily. At least I can't. Hope this is
useful to some of you and I look forward to continuing to learn about AWS.
